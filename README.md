List of applications and utilities that are awesome

# Utilities 
 - [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) Productivity application that allows me to use my macbook keyboard/mouse on my desktop. I configured my three desktop monitors to act as network displays for my mac, which means that I can just plop my laptop down and start working.
 - [Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com/) A stable and good app that uses my Android tablet as an external display. USB support is buggy, but wifi works good enough for slack etc.
 - [Muse](https://xzzz9097.github.io/) spotify controls for the touchbar that don't suck dick.
 - [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) Powerful and opensource daw for mac and linux

# Hardware
 - [Wireless earbuds](https://www.marshallheadphones.com/nl/en/mode-ii.html) what if airpods didn't suck dick
 - [iPad pro](#) Amazing for notes, as a second screen and ok-ish speakers
 - [Macbook pro hub](https://www.bol.com/nl/p/9-in-1-multifunctionele-macbook-pro-hub-15-16-inch-adapter-3x-usb-3-0-3x-usb-c-5k-60hz-hdmi-ethernet-rj45-aux-jack-plug/9200000026887324/?s2a=) the first dongle that I don't mind to carry around, its sleek and acts like a stand.
