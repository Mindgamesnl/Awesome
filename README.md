List of applications and utilities that are awesome

# Utilities 
 - [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) Productivity application that allows me to use my macbook keyboard/mouse on my desktop. I configured my three desktop monitors to act as network displays for my mac, which means that I can just plop my laptop down and start working.
 - [Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com/) A stable and good app that uses my Android tablet as an external display. USB support is buggy, but wifi works good enough for slack etc.
 - [Muse](https://xzzz9097.github.io/) spotify controls for the touchbar that don't suck dick.
 - [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) Powerful and opensource daw for mac and linux
